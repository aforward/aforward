# hugo-solstice-theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/hugo-solstice-theme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EclipseFdn/hugo-solstice-theme)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, build assets and start a webserver:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
hugo server --source=exampleSite --themesDir="../../" 
```

### Getting Started (Windows)

To install our dependencies on Windows, replace the previous `npm install`  with this one:
  
```bash
set NODE_ENV=production && npm install
```

#### Alternative Solution
  
Install [win-node-en](https://github.com/laggingreflex/win-node-env) globally and then install our dependencies by following the steps from our [Getting Started](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/hugo-solstice-theme#getting-started) section.

```bash
npm install -g win-node-env
```

### Known Issues

Versions of Hugo 0.60 and beyond do not support raw HTML in markdown files by default. To enable this feature, unsafe HTML rendering can be enabled in the Goldmark engine in the site configuration. This is not recommended as it exposes rendered content vulnerable to injected content on the site.
